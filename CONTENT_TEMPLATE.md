## Problem Section Content

### Card 1: Safety Concerns
```
In Northeast India alone, over 3,000 tourist incidents are reported annually, with many going unreported in remote areas. Traditional safety measures fail to provide adequate protection in challenging terrains like forests, mountains, and isolated tourist spots.
```

### Card 2: Delayed Response
```
Average emergency response time in remote tourist areas exceeds 45 minutes, with some locations taking over 2 hours. This critical delay can be life-threatening during medical emergencies, accidents, or security threats requiring immediate intervention.
```

### Card 3: Limited Tracking
```
Conventional tracking methods are ineffective in areas with poor network connectivity, dense forests, and mountainous regions. Tourists often venture into unmarked trails without any means of real-time location monitoring or emergency communication.
```

### Card 4: Identity Verification
```
Current manual verification systems at checkpoints are time-consuming, prone to errors, and lack centralized record-keeping. Missing person cases become complicated due to incomplete documentation and absence of digital trail of tourist movements.
